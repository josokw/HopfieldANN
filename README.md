Hopfield Artificial Neural Network
==================================
Console application implemented in ANSI-C. 

A Hopfield network is a recurrent artificial neural network (ANN) and was 
invented by John Hopfield in 1982. A Hopfield network is a one layered network.
Every neuron is connected to every other neuron except with itself. 
Every connection is represented by a weight factor. These weight factors are 
determined by the Hebb's learning rule (1949). 
Associative memory: capacity 0.14 * number of neurons.
