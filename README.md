Hopfield Artificial Neural Network
==================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josokw/HopfieldANN.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josokw/HopfieldANN)

A Hopfield network is a recurrent artificial neural network (ANN) and was
invented by John Hopfield in 1982. A Hopfield network is a one layered
network.
Every neuron is connected to every other neuron except with itself.

Every connection is represented by a weight factor. These weight factors
are determined by the Hebb's learning rule (1949). It is often summarized
as "Neurons that fire together, wire together. Neurons that fire out of
sync, fail to link".

Maximum Associative memory capacity: 0.14 * number of neurons.

Input format
------------

Four black-and-white images 10 x 12 (binary pattern, . black pixel, * white
pixel) in plain ASCII text:

        10 12 4

Building
--------

Use *CMake* and *make* to build the application in the build directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Executing
---------

If you are in the build directory:

    ./hopfieldann ../data/hopf02.dat

Output
------

The application shows the recovering from a distorted input to the trained
state that is most similar to that input. Hopfield networks have a scalar
value associated with each state of the network, referred to as the
"energy" of the network. Repeated updating of the network by using the
output as an input, will eventually converge to a state which is a local
minimum in the energy function. The weight factors are stored in a
connection matrix.
